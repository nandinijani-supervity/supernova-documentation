Supervity is a **self-driving operations platform** where AI agents act as autonomous operators — planning, executing, and monitoring work under human-defined policies.

Instead of manually building automation, you define **what outcome you want**, set boundaries, and let agents handle execution using tools, integrations, approvals, and schedules.

This documentation is structured to give **all users the same foundational understanding first**, and then guide you to role-specific use cases.

---

## Before You Start

No matter your role, everyone using Supervity works with the same core concepts:

- **Agents (Operators)** — who plans and executes work  
- **Jobs** — how work is executed step by step  
- **Auto Apps** — packaged operational capabilities  
- **Integrations** — tools agents use  
- **Approvals & Schedules** — governance and control  

Once these are clear, different roles simply apply them to different problems.
