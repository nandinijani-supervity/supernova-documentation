# Product Guide

This guide explains **how Supervity works**, independent of role.  
Before jumping into use cases, APIs, or advanced configurations, it’s important to understand the **core building blocks** and how they fit together.

Whether you are a business user, ops/admin, IT, or developer, everyone uses the same underlying primitives:
- operators
- jobs
- auto apps
- integrations
- approvals
- schedules

The difference across roles is **what you build**, not **how the platform works**.

## How to read this guide

If you’re new to Supervity, follow the order below.  
Each page builds on the previous one and establishes a shared mental model.

If you’re experienced, you can jump directly to the section you need — but the concepts remain the same.

## Recommended reading order

### 1. Platform Overview  
**[Platform Overview](/docs/product-guide/platform-overview)**

Start here to understand:
- what Supervity is at a system level
- the execution model of operators, jobs, and auto apps
- how humans, agents, and tools work together
- where integrations, approvals, and schedules fit in

This page defines the **language and concepts** used everywhere else.

### 2. Understanding Agents  
**[Understanding Agents](/docs/product-guide/agents-overview)**

Learn:
- what operators (agents) are
- how agents plan and execute work
- the difference between ad-hoc agents and saved agents
- how agents interact with workflows, tools, and humans

This explains *who* does the work inside the platform.

---

### 3. Workflows Explained  
**[Workflows Explained](/docs/product-guide/workflows-explained)**

Covers:
- what a workflow is
- how jobs are executed step by step
- branching, parallelism, and error handling
- human-in-the-loop workflows

This explains *how* work is structured and executed.

---

### 4. Integrations Overview  
**[Integrations Overview](/docs/product-guide/integrations-overview)**

Learn:
- how external systems are connected
- how integrations are used as tools by agents
- security and permission boundaries
- managing and troubleshooting integrations

All roles rely on integrations, regardless of use case.

---

### 5. Scheduling & Automation  
**[Scheduling & Automation](/docs/product-guide/scheduling-automation)**

Understand:
- how and when workflows run
- schedules, triggers, and webhooks
- retries, failures, and monitoring
- automation patterns across teams

This explains *when* work runs and how it’s operationalized.

## What to read next

Once you understand the product guide, you can move to role- or intent-specific sections:

- **Guides** — approvals, security, troubleshooting, best practices  
- **How-to** — common workflow patterns and real-world examples  
- **Reference** — APIs, payloads, and platform interfaces  
- **Tutorials** — step-by-step, hands-on walkthroughs  

The Product Guide is the foundation all of these build on.
