# Build Your First Email Automation Agent

In this tutorial, you'll create your first workflow: an automated email sender. This is a great way to understand how Supervity Agents works.

## What You'll Build

A workflow that sends a personalized email to a recipient. You'll learn:

- How to start a conversation with the agent
- How to describe your workflow goal
- How to approve and execute workflows
- How to save workflows for later use

## Step 1: Starting the Conversation

1. Open the workflow creation interface
2. Start a new conversation
3. Describe what you want: "I want to send an email to someone"

The agent will ask clarifying questions if needed, such as:

- Who should receive the email?
- What should the subject be?
- What should the content say?

## Step 2: Describing Your Workflow

Be specific about your requirements:

**Example:**

> "Create a workflow that sends a welcome email to new users. The email should have a subject line 'Welcome to Our Platform' and include a personalized greeting with the user's name."

The agent will:

1. **Plan** the workflow steps
2. **Validate** the plan
3. **Show you** a summary of what will happen

## Step 3: Understanding the Conversation Flow

The agent follows this process:

1. **Planning**: Creates a step-by-step plan
2. **Validation**: Checks for errors or missing information
3. **Approval**: Asks for your confirmation
4. **Execution**: Runs the workflow
5. **Saving**: Offers to save the workflow

### Example Conversation

```
You: "I want to send a welcome email to new users"

Agent: "I'll create a workflow that sends a welcome email.
       The workflow will need:
       - Recipient email address
       - Subject line
       - Email content

       Here's my plan:
       1. Send email with the provided details

       Does this look good?"

You: "Yes, that's perfect"

Agent: "Great! I'll execute the workflow now..."
```

## Step 4: Approving and Executing Workflows

When the agent shows you a plan:

1. **Review** the workflow steps
2. **Provide inputs** if requested (email address, subject, etc.)
3. **Approve** the workflow
4. **Watch** as it executes

The agent will show you:

- Each step as it completes
- Any errors that occur
- The final result

## Step 5: Saving Workflows

After execution, the agent will ask:

> "Would you like to save this workflow?"

- **Yes**: Give it a name and save for later use
- **No**: Keep it as a draft or discard

Saved workflows can be:

- Run again with different inputs
- Scheduled to run automatically
- Shared with your team

## Try It Yourself

1. Start a new workflow conversation
2. Ask the agent to "send an email"
3. Follow the conversation flow
4. Execute and save your first workflow!
