# Welcome to Supervity Agents

Welcome to Supervity Agents! This platform empowers you to create powerful automated workflows using AI agents. Whether you're automating email tasks, managing files, or building complex business processes, Supervity Agents makes it easy.

## What Are Workflows?

A **workflow** is a series of connected steps that automate a business process. Each step performs a specific action, and steps can depend on each other, run in parallel, or branch based on conditions.

### Key Concepts

- **Steps**: Individual actions in your workflow (e.g., "Send email", "Process file")
- **Dependencies**: Steps that must complete before others can start
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple steps running simultaneously
- **Conditional Branching**: Different paths based on conditions
- **Integrations**: Connections to external services (Gmail, Teams, Drive, etc.)

## What Are Agents?

**Agents** are AI-powered assistants that help you create workflows through natural conversation. Instead of writing code or configuring complex settings, you simply describe what you want to accomplish, and the agent builds the workflow for you.

### How Agents Work

1. **You describe your goal** in plain language
2. **The agent plans** the workflow steps
3. **The agent validates** the plan
4. **You approve** the workflow
5. **The agent executes** and saves your workflow
