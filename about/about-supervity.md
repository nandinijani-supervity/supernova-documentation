## About Supervity

Supervity builds **AI Employees for the Enterprise** — autonomous AI agents that help organizations run end-to-end operations with the right balance of **automation, human oversight, security, and governance**.

At its core, Supervity enables teams to **delegate operational work to AI agents** while keeping humans firmly in command through approvals, policies, and supervision.

Instead of manually designing and maintaining automation, teams define outcomes, constraints, and oversight — and Supervity agents plan, execute, and monitor the work.
